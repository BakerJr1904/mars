# Mars Convention
This is a fictional website about a mars convention. Mars conventions do happen, just this a fake one to practice my  skills wit HTML and CSS. I would love to know what you think. I know everyone's time is valuable, and I thank you for giving some to me. This fictional convention takes place in San Antonio, TX. I actually would go to mars if given the chance, so if you know anyone that could help me get there please help a brother out 🤣😂🤣
### My favorite thing to do is 👨‍💻
I love to code in many languages HTML, CSS, Ruby, Python 🐍<br/>
I also love to make FLASK apps
